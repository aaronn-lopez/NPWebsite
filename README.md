# NaloxAware - A Non-Profit Organization

#### Link to website found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

## Current version to date:
### Website is not yet hosted. Will be up in a week or two. Currently working on final touches, changes, and details that are requested by the organization. 

## How does it work?
### This is a front-end project that acts as the primary website for the non-profit organization NaloxAware. Founded earlier in the year 2024, NaloxAware aims to spread awareness about drugs and overdose prevention. More detail about the organization is found on the website. This project is ever changing as the organization changes. For future changes/plans, I plan to add a back end to this website for a user based system, easy firsthand contact with the organization, and more.
