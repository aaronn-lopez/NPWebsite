          <h2>About NaloxAware</h2>
            <p2>Here at NaloxAware, our goal is to educate underprivileged communities on the importance of Naloxone. 
              It is not only important for Narcan to be available for those at risk of overdosing but also for bystanders. 
              Naloxone is a highly effective anti-opioid agent and is not too troublesome for most to attain. 
              It is carried by many pharmacies, but not all. NaloxAware hopes to make Narcan more accessible by supplying people with it directly. 
              Factors which disrepute the strength of naloxone include a lack of awareness. Many communities lack access or information on THN kits 
              making it difficult for better safety precautions for prescription medications to be installed. 
              NaloxAware hopes to bring the power of naloxone into focus, as naloxone symbolizes second chances at life.</p2>

          <h2>What is Naloxone?</h2>
          <p2>Note that it is important to first understand how opioids work to understand Naloxone.
             Reversing an overdose within 2-5 minutes through Naloxone can work in 3 different forms, but all forms work towards the same overall goal.
             Naloxone can be given through nasal spray, injection under the skin, or injection into the veins.
              In the same way that substances reach the brain faster when injected, Naloxone works quickest when injected directly into the veins. 
              What Naloxone does do is replace and block the opioids on the nerve cells, prompting the reversal of respiratory depression as well as sedation. 
             Please acknowledge that naloxone has no effect on non-opioid substances, such as;
              benzodiazepines, psychostimulants, barbiturates, alcohol, sedatives or marijuana.
               Naloxone given to someone who does not require it will have no additional effect on them, so do not be hesitant to use it. 
               Furthermore, Naloxone may only be active for between 20-90 minutes while the lifespan of an opioid may last longer. 
               This means that it is still very much necessary to dial 911 and it may be necessary to dose a person repeatedly.
                Training for naloxone is available from pharmacists, when purchased or attained. For more on using naloxone, check
                 (insert link to different section on using it) on our page.</p2>
